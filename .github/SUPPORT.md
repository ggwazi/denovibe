## Where to Get Help

| Channel | Use for |
| ------- | ------- |
| [GitHub Discussions — Q&A](../../discussions/categories/q-a) | General questions, how-to, ideas |
| [GitHub Issues](../../issues) | **Confirmed bugs and feature requests only** |
| Stack Overflow [`denovibe`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/denovibe) | Public Q&A visible to the broader community |

## What NOT to Use Issues For

Please do **not** open a GitHub Issue for:

- General questions ("How do I…?")
- Support requests ("It doesn't work on my machine")
- Discussions about potential features without a concrete proposal

Use **GitHub Discussions** for those instead.

## Before Opening an Issue

Please check the following before filing a bug report:

- [ ] I have searched [existing issues](../../issues) and did not find a duplicate
- [ ] I have searched [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) for related topics
- [ ] I am running a [supported version](SECURITY.md#supported-versions) of denovibe
- [ ] I have read the [README](../README.md) and followed the quick-start steps
- [ ] I can reproduce the issue consistently with a minimal example
- [ ] I have included the output of `deno --version` in my report
